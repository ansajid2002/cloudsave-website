  <h2 className="my-8 font-semibold text-xl ">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
    <li>Log the purpose, scope, and recipient details;</li>
    <li>Adhere to the principles of minimization and necessity to protect your rights.</li>

  <p>We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers (e.g., IT or customer support) to deliver, optimize, and protect the Service. These providers access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf, and we ensure they handle it per our requirements.</p>
  
  <p>We may share infrastructure or systems with Cloudsave affiliates to provide the Service. Affiliates will use your information as described in this policy, and we remain responsible for their compliance.</p>

  <p>If you connect your Cloudsave account to a third-party service (e.g., Google for login), we and the third party may exchange information listed above to provide the Service. The third party’s privacy policy will govern their use of your information.</p>

  <p>For cross-border data transfers, we will establish mechanisms compliant with the DPDP Act and international standards, ensuring data protection through consent or other legitimate bases.</p>
  <h2 className="my-8 font-semibold text-xl ">How We Protect and Store Your Information</h2>
  <p>We employ a dedicated team to secure your information and test for vulnerabilities. We use encryption for files at rest, two-factor authentication, and alerts for new device logins to protect your data. Automated technologies detect abusive behavior or harmful content.</p>
  
  <p>We retain your information for as long as your account exists or as needed to provide the Service. If you request account deletion via <a href="mailto:support@cloudsave.org">support@cloudsave.org</a>, we will delete your account within 30 days after verifying your identity. Deletion from servers and backups may be delayed, and we may retain information to meet legal obligations or resolve disputes.</p>
  
  <p>We store your information for the period required to provide the Service, extended if required by law, agreed by you, necessary for security, or technically necessary. After the retention period, we will delete or de-identify your information per applicable laws.</p>
  
  <p>We follow the principle of data minimization, collecting only what is necessary and informing you of purposes via this policy, notifications, or prompts. We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption and trusted protection mechanisms, to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.</p>
  
  <p>Our employees undergo data security training and background checks. Only authorized personnel access your information, bound by nondisclosure agreements. Violations result in termination and legal accountability. We also enforce confidentiality when employees leave their roles.</p>
  
  <p>The internet is not fully secure, so protect your information when interacting with third-party services integrated with Cloudsave. Due to technical limitations and potential malicious attacks, we cannot guarantee absolute security, as issues may arise beyond our control.</p>
  
  <p>We treat personal information disclosure, damage, or loss as critical security events, activating an emergency response plan with a dedicated team to address and mitigate impacts. We maintain an emergency plan for network security risks (e.g., vulnerabilities, cyberattacks), taking remedial actions and reporting to authorities as required. Regular drills ensure preparedness.</p>
  
  <p>If a security event occurs, we will notify you per the DPDP Act via your provided contact details (e.g., email, phone, SMS) with details on the event, our measures, and your options to mitigate risks. If individual notification is impractical, we will issue public announcements. We may not notify you if our measures prevent harm, unless required by authorities.</p>
  
  <p>We adopt technical and organizational measures to minimize data collection and protect your rights, ensuring data processing aligns with specific purposes.</p>
  <h2 className="my-8 font-semibold text-xl ">Where We Store and Process Your Information</h2>
  <p>We may store, process, and transfer your information in India or other jurisdictions as needed to provide the Service. Your information may also be stored on the device you use to access the Service. By using the Service, you consent to such storage and processing.</p>
  
  <h2 className="my-8 font-semibold text-xl ">How You Control and Access Your Information</h2>
  <p>Under the DPDP Act and applicable laws, you have the following rights over your personal information. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cloudsave.org">support@cloudsave.org</a> with any questions or requests.</p>
  
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
    <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> Request details on how your information is collected, stored, processed, or shared, and the purposes for such processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Right of Rectification:</strong> Correct errors or supplement incomplete information by submitting a request after identity verification.</li>
    <li><strong>Right of Erasure:</strong> Request deletion of your information if:
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Our processing violates laws or agreements;</li>
        <li>The processing purpose is met or no longer necessary;</li>
        <li>We stop providing the Service, or the retention period expires;</li>
        <li>You withdraw consent;</li>
        <li>Required by law.</li>
      </ul>
      Deletion from backups may be delayed. If retention is required by law or technically necessary, we will stop processing except for storage and security.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> For non-essential data collection, you can withdraw consent at any time by adjusting device settings (e.g., disabling access to location) or contacting us. Withdrawal does not affect prior processing and may limit access to certain features.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Account Deletion:</strong> Delete your account via [Account Settings] - [Security] - [Delete Account]. Deletion may be delayed if you have active subscriptions or data, or if required by law. Once deleted, you cannot use the Service, and your information will be removed per your request, subject to legal obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Request a copy of your information or its transfer to another entity, where technically feasible and permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>We will update third parties (e.g., service providers) on your requests to ensure compliance. If your request is unjustified or excessive (e.g., repetitive), we may:</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
    <li>Charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs;</li>
    <li>Refuse to act on the request.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 className="my-8 font-semibold text-xl ">Changes</h2>
