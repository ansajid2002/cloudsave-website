      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Subscription Storage Upgrades & Paid Features</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Additional storage or features are available through paid plans (“Paid Service”). The Paid Service is available
        until your subscription expires. Subscriptions renew automatically (monthly or annually) unless canceled before
        the renewal date. We will charge the subscription fee at purchase and upon each renewal, regardless of your usage.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You may cancel your subscription at any time via{" "}
        <a href="https://cloudsave.org/account" className="underline text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://cloudsave.org/account
        </a>{" "}
        or your app store for in-app purchases. No refunds will be provided for fees paid before cancellation, including
        after automatic renewals.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you fail to pay for the Paid Service on time, we may restrict your storage to 1TB (free account limit). If your
        storage exceeds 1TB, you cannot upload new data or use certain features until you reduce usage below 1TB.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may change fees, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for updates.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Subscription and Auto-Renewal Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Subscription Period:</strong> The Paid Service is available for the duration of your subscription period
        (e.g., monthly or annually), as selected at purchase. You will have access to the Paid Service until the
        subscription expires or is canceled.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (e.g.,
        monthly or annually) unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the renewal date. The same payment method used
        for the initial purchase will be charged at the rate applicable at the time of renewal, which may start up to 24
        hours before the new billing cycle begins.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Price Changes:</strong> If the subscription price changes, the new price will apply to the next billing
        cycle. It is your responsibility to review the subscription terms for updates. You may cancel your subscription if
        you do not wish to pay the new price, as described below.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Access After Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel your subscription, you will retain access to the Paid
        Service until the end of the current billing cycle for which you have paid. No further charges will apply after
        cancellation. For example, if you purchase an annual subscription on January 1, 2025, for ₹1,000 and cancel on
        July 1, 2025, you will have access until December 31, 2025, and no additional charge will apply on January 1,
        2026.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Subscription fees are non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or as
        specified in our refund policy or the refund policies of Google Play or the App Store.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Payment Plans:</strong> If you commit to a multi-payment plan (e.g., installment payments for an annual
        subscription), you cannot cancel remaining payments for the current plan but can stop auto-renewal for future
        cycles. You remain responsible for all payments in the current plan.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Free Trials:</strong> If you subscribe to a free or discounted trial, you must cancel at least 24 hours
        before the trial ends to avoid charges. Upon cancellation during the trial, you will lose access to the Paid
        Service unless otherwise specified.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How to Cancel Auto-Renewal</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You may cancel your subscription’s auto-renewal at any time to prevent future charges. Cancellation must be
        processed through the platform where you purchased the subscription (Cloudsave website, Google Play for Android,
        or App Store for iOS). Uninstalling the Cloudsave app will not cancel your subscription. Below are instructions
        for canceling on Android and iOS.
